# NBA_Offensive_Movement
 Determining the releationship between offensive movement and offensive production in the NBA.

I was reading an article about proving whether or not Andrew Wiggins *Does Andrew Wiggins Have an Effort Problem?*

Judging effort on scoring efficiency seems somewhat flawed, so I considered other methods of quantifying effort: Distance traveled. The NBA has tracked it since The 13-14 season--a year before Wiggins entered the league. However, I realized that distance traveled can be skewed by the playstyle of a particular team. Teams such as the Rockets often prioritize spacing over movement. They spread across the court to open up driving lanes or isolate defenders for their stars (particularly James Harden) to attack.
